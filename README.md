## Continuous In-situ Measurements of Low-altitude Cloud Particles at the Zeppelin Observatory

The largest source of uncertainties in estimating the radiative response to a warming climate in global climate models comes from the representation of clouds, which modulate the radiative transfer through the atmosphere and drive a number of feedback processes. The uncertainty in our prediction of the Arctic climate is further exacerbated by Arctic amplification processes. Despite their importance, however, our understanding of dynamic and thermodynamic properties of clouds is still far from complete. This is largely due to the difficulties involved in making detailed observations of the properties of the Arctic clouds. To this end, continuous in-situ measurements of liquid droplets were made at the Zeppelin Observatory, Svalbard, using a cloud particle spectrometre called the Cloud Droplet Probe. Post-processed time-series of cloud liquid water concentration, number concentration and particle size distribution are presented and examined against existing in-situ observations of cloud particle size distributions; the results confirm that these measurements provide a detailed look at the properties of low-altitude cloud properties, which can be use dto improve our understanding of the convective activities in the Arctic atmosphere.
